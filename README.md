# Iranian Quote Generator

This project is inspired by the beauty and wisdom of Persian literature. It is an Iranian version of a quote generator, featuring inspiring sayings from notable Iranian figures. The website is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON to dynamically render quotes in a user-friendly and visually appealing format.

## Features
- **Dynamic Quote Display**: Fetches and displays quotes from a JSON file dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
- **Social Media Integration**: Provides quick access to related profiles via clickable icons.

## How It Works
1. **JSON Data**: Contains an array of poets, each with their respective quotes.
2. **JavaScript Logic**: Fetches data, processes quotes, and handles user interactions (e.g., navigating to the next quote).
3. **Styled Layout**: The interface uses CSS for a clean and modern design, incorporating background images and hover effects for interactivity.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Serve the files using a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python's SimpleHTTPServer).
3. Open the website in your browser to explore the collection of quotes.

## Inspiration
This project pays homage to Iranian poets and thinkers by providing an interactive platform to appreciate their timeless wisdom. It encourages users to reflect on meaningful sayings while enjoying a visually enriched experience.
